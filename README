KIR peptide predictor: input peptides and binding data into training csv file, and then predict binding of other peptides in PeptidePredict.csv.



Reads training dataset 
  - first column: single letter amino acids sequences
  - second column: normalized binding data (0-1)
  
Converts ninemers into vector of numbers

Classifies binding data into high, medium, and non-binders.

Splits 80% of dataset to train the model, 20% to test it (train_split_test function of sklearn)

Uses RandomForestClassifier model (default settings)

Classifies prediction peptides from PredictPeptides.csv as high, medium, and non-binders
